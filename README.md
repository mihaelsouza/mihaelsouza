### Greetings and Salutations, ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mihael, and I'm a researcher turned into Software Developer. 

Over time I realized that most of the accomplishments I was proud of from my time in academia were coding/software related,
so I thought it was about time to take the plunge into this vast universe of software development.

I am passionate about data, probably because I've dealt with a lot of it during my research ðŸ˜…, and fascinated about machine learning and AI.
I started learning programming with MATLAB and R, but really fell in love with it when I started using Python.

I'm currently invested in getting better with full-stack development ðŸŒ± using technologies under the TypeScript/JavaScript umbrella. 
I want to keep building interesting models and data-driven applications using Python and Tensorflow/Keras on the backend, and make them available to users on the browser and mobile. What good is a nice model/AI if no one can enjoy its benefits, right? ðŸ’¥

Want to collaborate? ðŸ‘¯
Hit me up and let's build cool things together!

Nice to meet you :bowtie:
